### **My name is Tom Settle and I am currently a junior at Indiana University.**

That’s my headline. As a 20 year old that was raised from a loving family in suburbia Indianapolis, a student is what I was going to be until I graduated college. “A junior at Indiana University,” its a blessing to say and I am very fortunate to be able to attend college but lets face it that’s not who I am. No one is simply a student, or a doctor, lawyer, etc.

I am at a point where I am deciding what I truly want to do with my life and step one is figuring out who I am. What do I love and what makes me tick? We are all different and sometimes all it takes is for us to think about who we are to realize what we want to do with our lives. That is what this mission is. “FINDING MY PASSION.” What I am really actually seriously passionate about? Well I can’t really tell you, all I can tell you is that I want to try as much as I can before deciding. And this is one of those tries. Social Media is an outlet, tool, and interests of mine. A virtual community that can provide knowledge, entertainment, and support. This part of the journey is exploring these new social media outlets such as medium.

Here is my Instagram, an outlet for me to express my creativity through pictures and video.

### **What to expect from me**
I want to document this journey for both my and your benefit. I want to create my content based on interests in my life, for you to get to know me better and also I want to create a community. Not a following, a community. Social media is made to interact and I intend to use it that way.

This post is meant to start this journey and get this ball rolling.
