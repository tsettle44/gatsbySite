The time has come for me to get a new phone and it got me thinking.

I bought the iPhone 7 plus a little less than two years ago and just recently pre-ordered the S9 plus. Yes, I made the switch but that will be for another story.

Upon paying for the nearly $1,000 device I couldn’t believe that in my head it was OK for me to think that this phone would probably last me two years like my previous phone did. I started to do some research on planned obsolescence and more particularly in the technology industry.

For those that do not know, planned obsolescence is a purposefully implemented strategy that ensures the current version of a given product will become out-of-date or useless within a known time period.

We all know it goes on, but to what scale? Get this nearly 120 years ago a light bulb was created, that light bulb has been burning since… you can check the live feed [here](http://www.centennialbulb.org/) updated every 30 minutes  

That puts into perspective the capabilities of products back then, but then a business man came in and said no no we need to design these to last only 1,000 hours so consumers buy more. Good business strategy? Sure, but kinda sucks that the full capability of the technology is not even being touched. Can you imagine what it’s like in today’s day and age?

Most recently Apple was accused of purposely throttling performance of older model phones in the midst of the iPhone 8 and 8 plus releasing. This is something that is not new and its been proven that software updates will degrade performance of older devices. It’s a shame, but perhaps a greater shame that I have to get a new phone because the software is limiting the capability of the phone, not the hardware… the software. Not only is this consumer manipulation but think about all the waste technology companies are producing due to the planned obsolescence of devices. And technology is not exactly the easiest thing to recycle.

When is planned obsolescence OK?

I have thought about this too, and there are certainly times where it is OK, but I don’t think there is a place for it in tech. For example, baby clothes, manufactures are not creating baby clothes with the same quality of a Rolex watch, because baby clothes shouldn’t last that long. If they did then they would be way too expensive.

There are many other examples where it is OK but perhaps my point here is that there is no place for it in technology. Let me know what you think.
