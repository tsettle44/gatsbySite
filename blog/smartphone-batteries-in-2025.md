### **Had this thought so I figured I would write it down.**

I enjoy fantasizing about the future of technology and stretching my brain to think of the unimaginable things that will be possible in the near future. In simplistic terms these great feats of innovation are simply to solve a problem, and a problem I have with my smart phone is its battery.

**So here is my prediction for what smartphone batteries will look like in 2025**

plain and simple they won’t exist.

Battery power will become a commodity that is available like 4G LTE is available where ever we go.

Think about networks, and the history of those.

The Ethernet cable was created in the 1970’s and a true innovation to data transferring between devices. Lets think of this as our charging cable perhaps?

Next comes WiFi… or wireless charging? Here we disconnect from our Ethernet cables and are able to get access to networks, although only in places that have WiFi. Sounds a lot like wireless charging, we break away from the cables to charge batteries but only in certain places and devices that offer wireless charging. Next we get cell phone providers offering fast reliable network service across entire countries. We pay for it, but this allows us to go anywhere in the world and connect to the internet.

**How about this…**

The next step in wireless charging is creating the technology that can charge devices without actually touching a charging pad (this is already created but needs to be developed and made safer). This sounds a lot like our WiFi hot spot. I walk into my home and my phone charges… I walk into my home my phone connects to WiFi. Sounds legit.

This is great and all but I still have a battery in my phone that is being charged and once I leave a “charging hot spot” it is no longer charging.

So then the next step is, power provided similar to that of 4G LTE.

Now, we are talking. Now I may not even need a battery at all. Now my device can always have power wherever I go. Maybe devices will keep small reserves of battery if dead spots still occur like they do in network providers, but hey call me crazy. This might just work.

This is simply just my mind running on ideas, but I wrote this because I am curious what people think about this, and perhaps some more technical expertise can weigh in.
